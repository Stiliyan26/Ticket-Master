# AI-Assisted Development

## Core Philosophy

> AI is a **multiplier**, not a replacement. Use it to amplify your skills, not bypass learning.

---

## Effective Prompting Patterns

### The CONTEXT-TASK-RULES Pattern

```
I'm building [CONTEXT - what you're working on].
I need to [SPECIFIC TASK - be precise].
Here's my current code: [CODE or file reference].
Following these rules: [@coding-standards.mdc, @error-handling.mdc].
What's the best approach and why?
```

### Good vs Bad Prompts

| ❌ Bad            | ✅ Good                                                                                                                  |
| ----------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| "Write a service" | "Create a NestJS service method that bulk-creates seats for a venue, with transaction support and proper error handling" |
| "Fix this bug"    | "This method throws 'Cannot read property X'. Here's the code and stack trace. What's the root cause?"                   |
| "Make it better"  | "Review this code for: 1) N+1 queries, 2) Missing error handling, 3) Violations of our coding-standards.mdc"             |

## When to Trust AI

| Trust Level | Scenario                       | Action                                 |
| ----------- | ------------------------------ | -------------------------------------- |
| 🟢 High     | Boilerplate, DTOs, simple CRUD | Review quickly, likely correct         |
| 🟡 Medium   | Business logic, validation     | Review carefully, test edge cases      |
| 🔴 Low      | Security, auth, transactions   | Verify thoroughly, consult docs        |
| ⛔ Never    | Crypto, passwords, secrets     | Write yourself or use vetted libraries |

### Red Flags in AI-Generated Code

- [ ] Uses deprecated APIs
- [ ] Missing error handling
- [ ] Overly complex solution for simple problem
- [ ] Doesn't follow project patterns
- [ ] Security vulnerabilities (SQL injection, XSS)
- [ ] Missing null/undefined checks

---

## Learning with AI

### Ask for Understanding, Not Just Code

```
// ❌ Bad - just get code
"Write a distributed lock implementation"

// ✅ Good - learn while building
"Explain how distributed locks work in Redis.
What are the failure modes?
Then show me a NestJS implementation with Redlock."
```

### Challenge the AI

| Question                   | Why Ask                                 |
| -------------------------- | --------------------------------------- |
| "Is there a better way?"   | AI often gives first solution, not best |
| "What are the trade-offs?" | Understand pros/cons of approach        |
| "What could go wrong?"     | Identify edge cases and failures        |
| "Why this over X?"         | Learn decision-making rationale         |

### Spaced Repetition Pattern

1. **Day 1**: AI helps you build feature
2. **Day 2**: Try to rebuild without AI, reference when stuck
3. **Day 7**: Build similar feature from scratch
4. **Result**: Knowledge moves to long-term memory

## Code Review Checklist for AI Code

Before accepting AI-generated code, verify:

### Architecture

- [ ] Follows our `coding-standards.mdc`
- [ ] Respects module boundaries
- [ ] Uses proper dependency injection
- [ ] Doesn't introduce circular dependencies

### Error Handling

- [ ] Follows `error-handling.mdc`
- [ ] Throws appropriate exceptions
- [ ] Handles edge cases
- [ ] Doesn't swallow errors silently

### Security

- [ ] No hardcoded secrets
- [ ] Input validation present
- [ ] SQL injection safe (parameterized queries)
- [ ] No exposed internal details in errors

### Performance

- [ ] No N+1 queries
- [ ] Appropriate use of transactions
- [ ] No memory leaks (streams for large data)
- [ ] Pagination for lists

### Testing

- [ ] Code is testable (dependencies injectable)
- [ ] Edge cases identified
- [ ] Error paths covered

## AI Tool Integration

### Cursor-Specific Tips

| Feature     | Use Case                            |
| ----------- | ----------------------------------- |
| `@file`     | Reference specific file for context |
| `@folder`   | Reference entire folder             |
| `@codebase` | Search across codebase              |
| `@docs`     | Reference documentation             |
| `@web`      | Search web for current info         |

### Rule File References

Always reference relevant rules in prompts:

```
Following @coding-standards.mdc and @error-handling.mdc,
implement the findAll method for SeatsService with pagination.
```

## Anti-Patterns

### Don't Do This

| ❌ Anti-Pattern                       | Why Bad                            | ✅ Instead                      |
| ------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------- | ------------------------------- |
| Copy-paste without reading            | Miss bugs, don't learn             | Read, understand, then use      |
| Ask AI to "fix" without understanding | Won't learn the fix                | Ask "why is this broken?" first |
| Use AI for everything                 | Lose fundamental skills            | Practice basics without AI      |
| Skip tests because AI said it works   | AI doesn't test your edge cases    | Always test AI code             |
| Trust AI on security                  | AI can suggest vulnerable patterns | Verify against OWASP, docs      |

## Productivity Workflow

### The 15-Minute Rule

1. **Stuck for 15 min?** → Ask AI for hints (not solution)
2. **Stuck for 30 min?** → Ask AI for approach options
3. **Stuck for 1 hour?** → Get AI solution, study it, delete, rebuild

### Daily AI Learning Practice

```
Morning: Build one feature with AI assistance
Afternoon: Build similar feature WITHOUT AI
Evening: Compare approaches, note learnings
```

## Metrics to Track

| Metric                                  | Target     | Why                      |
| --------------------------------------- | ---------- | ------------------------ |
| AI suggestions accepted without changes | < 50%      | You should be refining   |
| Time to understand AI code              | Decreasing | You're learning patterns |
| Features built without AI               | Increasing | Skills transferring      |
| Bugs from AI code                       | Decreasing | Better review process    |
