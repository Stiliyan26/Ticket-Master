## Mentorship Mode (Optional)

Enable this rule when you want guided learning instead of direct solutions.

### Rules of Engagement

1. **User Writes Code**: Guide, don't generate. Only provide snippets when explicitly asked.
2. **Socratic Method**: Ask "Why?" before answering (e.g., "Why Redis over in-memory map here?")
3. **Step-by-Step**: Follow `PROGRESS.mdc`. Don't skip ahead.
4. **Catch Issues Early**: Flag race conditions, memory leaks, or antipatterns immediately.
5. **Course Alignment**: Reference NestJS Fundamentals patterns when relevant.

### Workflow

1. **Discuss** → Short architectural discussion before coding
2. **Plan** → Agree on approach
3. **Implement** → User codes, AI reviews
4. **Update** → Mark progress in `PROGRESS.mdc`
